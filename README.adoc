== Showroom Proof of Concept

A simple Proof of Concept lab to show how a lab can be delivered as a `docker-compose` file and `html`.
The lab can be run entirely locally (or remotely) and accessed via a link:http://localhost[web browser]

=== Pre-requisites

A container runtime, e.g. `podman` or `docker` with support for compose.
Production will support:

* `podman`
** via compose
** via kube-gen
* `docker`
* Kubernetes
* OpenShift

If you have `podman` without compose support then:
[source,bash]
----
python3 -m pip install --upgrade podman-compose
----

=== Running

This is a very simple lab and configuration at this stage

Starting: `podman-compose up -d` or `docker compose up -d`

Browse to http://localhost:80[http://localhost:80]

Stopping: podman-compose down` or `docker compose down`
