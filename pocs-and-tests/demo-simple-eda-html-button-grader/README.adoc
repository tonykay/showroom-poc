== Overview

Simple standalone PoC showing:

* Using Ansible Rulebook to create a webhook handler.
* Using an HTML button to POST to ansible-rulebook handler

== Setup

You will need to install the following:

* Ansible Rulebook (see requirements.yml)
** `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`
** `pip install ansible-rulebook`
* Ideally use a virtualenv, see ./requirements-python-3.10.10.txt

=== Running a simple test (multiple terminal windows useful for this, and assumed)

. In terminal window/pane 1 run the rulebook
.. `ansible-rulebook -r event-handler-rulebook.yml -i inventory --verbose`
. In terminal window/pane 2 run the curl command to verify the rulebook is running and responding correctly
.. `curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"action": "Check Me", "module" : 1 }' http://127.0.0.1:8000/endpoint`
+
NOTE: You can change the curl payload to set `"module" : 2` to test the second module.

=== Test via HTML button

. In terminal window/pane 1 run the rulebook (as above)
. In terminal window/pane 2 run a webserver e.g.
`python3 -m http.server 80`
. In a browser open http://localhost:80/index.html
.. Click the button to POST to the rulebook
